## Welcome

Welcome to the project unit! Your final project is the pinnacle of your degree.
It is a chance for you to demonstrate what you have learnt and what you are
capable of. It makes up a significant part of your degree classification. It
will be challenging, and you will need to demonstrate that you can overcome
this challenge. That said, it will also be one of the most fulfilling parts of
your degree, since it is a chance to focus on what you want to do, supported by
one-on-one sessions with experts in the field.
